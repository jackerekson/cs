Continuous Integration

Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands. As of June 2019, the Jenkins organization on GitHub had 667 project members and around 2,200 public repositories. The Jenkins project was originally named Hudson, and was renamed in 2011 after a dispute with Oracle, which had forked the project and claimed rights to the project name.  Hudson was founded in 1999. 

The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

The Jenkins project produces two release lines: Stable (LTS) and regular (Weekly). Depending on your organization's needs, one may be preferred over the other.

Many public cloud vendors provide their own Jenkins installation guides and packages. The guides provide instructions to deploy, maintain, and upgrade on the specific public cloud. Such guides may be used to quickly deploy Jenkins and, in many cases, to get an instance preconfigured to be used within the public cloud (e.g. bundled plugins, integrations with public cloud services, etc.)
